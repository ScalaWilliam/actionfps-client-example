Requirements:
* [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html)
* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

In command line, do:
```
sbt run
```

To develop and understand the code, I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition).

When you clone the project, in IntelliJ do File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources... and select the "build.sbt" file in this directory.
